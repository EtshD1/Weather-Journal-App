## JavaScript Code

The two main files for this project are the `server.js` and the `app.js`.
[server.js](https://github.com/EtshD1/Weather-Journal-App/blob/main/server.js) is responsible for server-side code, and [app.js](https://github.com/EtshD1/Weather-Journal-App/blob/main/website/app.js) is responsible for the client-side code.

## Functionality

This Project presents my ability to work with expressJS, APIs, and asynchronicity.
